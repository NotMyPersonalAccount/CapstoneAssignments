                  People are often only exposed to existing proprietary software
                  such as Windows.

                  People may not otherwise have been exposed to open-source
                  software, and so they might think because they’ve never seen
                  or heard of it and it isn’t widely used, it must be because
                  it’s bad quality.

                  Developers are oftentimes not paid for their contributions.

                  People may think that the quality of work is not good if the
                  developers are not paid, because of the misconceptions that
                  either there might not be as much effort put in or the
                  developers are not qualified.

            <p>
              People must be shown how good open-source software can be in
              contrast to proprietary software alternatives so that they may
              actually consider using it.

              <h3>Root Cause #2</h3>
              <p>
                There is reluctance around transitioning to open-source
                software.

                <h4>Evidence</h4>
                <p>
                  Existing software being used may be using proprietary file
                  formats to store information (i.e documents) that are not well
                  handled by other software.
                  <a class="footnote" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>

                <h4>Explantion</h4>
                <p>
                  Because the existing proprietary file formats can not be
                  handled well, or at all, migrating may require some time and
                  effort. Additionally, others may continue using the previous
                  file formats, requiring extra effort to share files.

                <h4>Evidence</h4>
                <p>
                  People often only know how to use existing proprietary
                  software that they’d learned first.

                <p>
                  People need to relearn things with the new software, which
                  they stubbornly might not want to do. Additionally, this takes
                  some time and effort and temporarily reduces productivity and
                  efficiency.

            <h3>Implications</h3>
            <p>
              This issue can be solved with more common usage of open standards.
              Therefore, formats can continue to be used both internally and
              externally for an organization, and less effort is required to
              migrate.
