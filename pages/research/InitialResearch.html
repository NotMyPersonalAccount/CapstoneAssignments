            <h1>Problem</h1>
            Adoption and support of open source software is low due to both the
            many misconceptions, and the simple lack of awareness. In contrast,
            proprietary software is considered the norm despite the lack of
            transparency, or ability to fix and otherwise modify the software,
            in cases where those rights should exist.

          <div id="need" class="col py-5">
            <h1>Need</h1>
            Awareness needs to be raised about what open source software is,
            both the advantages and disadvantages, in contrast to proprietary
            software. Misconceptions must also be addressed.

                <span class="reason">Security</span>
                People tend to believe that open source software is less secure
                than their proprietary counterparts because source code is
                available, when that often is not the case.

              <li>
                <span class="reason">Quality</span>
                Open source software is often thought as being inferior because
                its "free." That, however, is not always the case, and there is
                a lot of awesome software that is open source.

                <span class="reason">User Friendliness</span>
                Open source software is often associated with being "for
                developers", and while there is a lot of software that is for
                developers, there is also a lot of software that is not.
