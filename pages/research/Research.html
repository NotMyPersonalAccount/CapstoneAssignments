        <h1>Research Question</h1>
        <p>How can we increase adoption of free open source software?</p>
        <h1>Context</h1>
        <p>
          Proprietary software, as opposed to open software, is very commonly
          used by everyday people. This software does not allow for the user to
          know fully what it is doing or to maintain it, resulting in full
          reliance on a company.
        </p>
        <p>
          Open-source software adoption is rather low in many cases despite
          alternatives existing.
        </p>
        <h1>Solution</h1>
        <p>
          Through the use of social media, and nice-looking websites to showcase
          open-source software, awareness and perception can be improved.
